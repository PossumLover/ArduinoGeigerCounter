# ArduinoGeigerCounter
A simple Geiger Counter based on the RaditationD-v1.1 (CAJOE) and an Arduino Uno. 

## How it works 

Uses a M4011 tube with the RadiationD-v1.1 (CAJOE) that can be purchased easily online via AliExpress, Banggood, Ebay and other vendors. Other online code packages didn't keep the sensor simple in design, so I am making it so the counts are displayed on a simple screen. 

## How to set-up 

The CAJOE module can be run from the Arudino 5V supply. I have used Pin 2 for the VIN output. Outputs total clicks and time since program start to LCD screen to allow for easy calculation of average clicks per minute.
